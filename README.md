# single-pong
Creates a basic single player Pong game against a CPU.

Language: Rust

This is my first real project in Rust, so I'm giving a crack at it with my typical first pass to learn some code by implementing Pong. This allows me to understand some of the syntax and operations while simultaneously working on my skills with event handlers. I am excited for this project because I decided that this would be a good first program to build with Rust once I learned more about the language.

First Release:
- Code ETA: 3/31/2025. some setbacks happened that pushed the code release back by a couple days
- code is not yet available as I am working on commenting it extensively to check my own understanding of the syntax
- First pass will just be a simple implementation of a single player pong that is very basic.
- No scores will show, and it will just be a constant flow.

  Additional Updates:
  - I plan to add a settings menu that allows the user to set the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Impossible)
  - I also plan to add an option to activate "Ultra Instinct Mode" where all speeds of paddles and the ball are increased significantly.
  - Eventually, I plan to add a progression system, where there is a "story mode"
  - Story mode will contain infinite levels that increase in difficulty at certain milestones.
  - Final update will make it into a fully fledged application that saves your record with story mode and has an arcade-style leaderboard at the end for users
  - Final update will also hopefully include sound effects when hitting the ball, when a player scores, and when the game is over.
  - Another planned feature will be a challenge mode where additional obstacles are placed at various positions that add additional challenge to the game for users to practice their precision

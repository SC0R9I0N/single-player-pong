# single-pong
Creates a basic single player Pong game against a CPU.

NOTE: I will be working on this a small bit here and there, but I won't really get the chance to really hit hard on the code until after my semester ends. Once my semester ends, then I will be going full steam on my projects

Language: Rust

This is my first real project in Rust, so I'm giving a crack at it with my typical first pass to learn some code by implementing Pong. This allows me to understand some of the syntax and operations while simultaneously working on my skills with event handlers. I am excited for this project because I decided that this would be a good first program to build with Rust once I learned more about the language.

First Release:
- First pass is just a simple implementation of a single player pong that is very basic.
- No scores will show, and it will just be a constant flow.

  Additional Updates:
  - I plan to add a settings menu that allows the user to set the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, Impossible)
  - I also plan to add an option to activate "Ultra Instinct Mode" where all speeds of paddles and the ball are increased significantly.
  - Eventually, I plan to add a progression system, where there is a "story mode"
  - Story mode will contain infinite levels that increase in difficulty at certain milestones.
  - Final update will make it into a fully fledged application that saves your record with story mode and has an arcade-style leaderboard at the end for users
  - Final update will also hopefully include sound effects when hitting the ball, when a player scores, and when the game is over.
  - Another planned feature will be a challenge mode where additional obstacles are placed at various positions that add additional challenge to the game for users to practice their precision

Other Ideas:
- Power-ups such as paddle size increasing/decreasing, multi-ball, sticky paddle, etc.
- add a spin mechanic for the ball to add more physics
- add more paddle shapes/behaviors
- increase the quality of the AI that doesn't just increase its speed
- Visual effects such as ball trail, score flash, hit effects, etc.
- ghost mode where it allows players to play against a "ghost" of the best game played
